# MODULE - 4 ASSIGNMENT

## 1)  What is the significance of MAC layer and in which position it is placed in the OSI model

The MAC (Medium Access Control) layer is very important in wireless communication because it controls how devices share and use the wireless channel. It decides when to send or receive data to avoid collisions and ensures that data reaches the correct destination. It also handles things like addressing, frame formatting, and error checking. In the OSI model, the MAC layer is part of the Data Link Layer, which is Layer 2, and it sits just above the Physical Layer.

## 2) Describe the frame format of the 802.11 MAC header and explain the purpose of each fields

The 802.11 MAC header includes several fields. The Frame Control field tells the type of frame and controls various operations. The Duration/ID field shows how long the medium will be reserved. There are up to four Address fields used for sender, receiver, and AP identification. The Sequence Control field helps with the correct order of frames. The QoS Control field is used for quality of service if needed. The Frame Body carries the actual data, and the FCS (Frame Check Sequence) is used to detect any transmission errors.
