# Module 3 and 4 Assessment
## 1. Simulate a small network with switches and multiple devices. Use ping to generate traffic and observe the MAC address table of the switch. Capture packets using Wireshark to analyze Ethernet frames and MAC addressing.

 I used Cisco Packet Tracer to simulate a small network consisting of a 2960 series switch and three PCs. First, I added the switch and three end devices (PC-0, PC-1, and PC-2) and connected them using Copper Straight-Through cables. PC-0 was connected to FastEthernet0/1, PC-1 to FastEthernet0/2, and PC-2 to FastEthernet0/3 on the switch. Next, I configured static IP addresses for each PC: 192.168.1.10 for PC-0, 192.168.1.20 for PC-1, and 192.168.1.30 for PC-2, all with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. To test network connectivity, I used the ping command from PC-0 to PC-1 and PC-2, confirming successful communication. After that, I accessed the switchâ€™s CLI (Command Line Interface) and used the show mac address-table command to observe the learned MAC addresses. To analyze Ethernet frames, I switched to Simulation Mode, enabled ICMP filtering, and sent pings between devices. I captured and inspected the packets to examine details like Source MAC Address, Destination MAC Address, Ethertype, and Payload.

## 2.Capture and analyze Ethernet frames using Wireshark. Inspect the structure of the frame, including destination and source MAC addresses, Ethertype, payload, and FCS. Use GNS3 or Packet Tracer to simulate network traffic.

I used Wireshark to capture and analyze Ethernet frames while simulating network traffic in Cisco Packet Tracer. First, I created a small network with a switch (2960 series) and two PCs (PC-0 and PC-1) in Packet Tracer. I connected the devices using Copper Straight-Through cables and assigned static IP addresses: 192.168.1.10 for PC-0 and 192.168.1.20 for PC-1, both with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. I then used the ping command from PC-0 to PC-1 to generate ICMP traffic. To capture Ethernet frames, I switched to Simulation Mode in Packet Tracer, enabled ICMP filtering, and analyzed the packets.


## 3. Configure static IP addresses, modify MAC addresses, and verify network connectivity using ping and ifconfig commands.
